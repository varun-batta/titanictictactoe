    <!-- Instructions -->
    <string name="instructionsPrompt">Do you already know how Tic Tac Toe works?</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions1">No worries! Since you don\'t know how Tic Tac Toe works, let\'s give you a quick intro. Start by tapping on any one of the available squares</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions2">Since you started off the game, you are X this time around. Your opponent can now make a move in any one of the remaining squares and they are O</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions3">Now, before we continue, let\'s clarify what your goal is</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions4">You are trying to get your symbol, X in this case, to be either 3 in a row</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions5">You are trying to get your symbol, X in this case, to be either 3 in a row, 3 in a column</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions6">You are trying to get your symbol, X in this case, to be either 3 in a row, 3 in a column, or 3 in a diagonal</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions7">Now let\'s play a bit</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions8">Well done! Remember to make sure your opponent doesn\'t get 3 in a row and they will be doing the same</string>
    <string name="level1Instructions9">Hope you enjoyed! If you\'d like to try to learn how we make Tic Tac Toe a little more complicated, please click Next. If you\'d like to continue practicing for now and perhaps try later, feel free to look at the instructions again (just click Yes when asking whether you know Tic Tac Toe already since now you do!)</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions1">Great! Let\'s show you the next level of Tic Tac Toe. Start by tapping on any one of the available squares</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions2">Oh, look at that! Since you picked the %s square, your opponent is only allowed to play in the %s section of the board (everything that is red cannot be clicked on). Let\'s let them make a move</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions3">As you can see, this is more complicated since we are moving around the entire board. But the goal is the same as regular tic tac toe. You keep moving around and try to win the different sections by getting 3 in a row, column or diagonal</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions4You">Awesome! It looks like you can win this section of the board</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions4Opponent">It looks like your opponent will win this section of the board</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions5You">Now you\'ll want to click here</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions5Opponent">They\'ll want to click here</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions6You">Awesome! You just won the %s section!</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions6Opponent">Oh no! Your opponent just won the %s section!</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions6">As you can see, it became a giant %s! To win the game, you have to continue playing and try to win 3 sections in a row, column or diagonal. So you can think of this as Tic Tac Toe in Tic Tac Toe :)</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions7Part1">Oh, and one more thing you should be aware of.</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions7Part2">Oh, and one more thing you should be aware of. If you or your opponent click in any of the highlighted areas at any point, since that particular section is not available, the entire game board would become available.</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions7Part3">So it would look like this.</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions8">Now let\'s play!</string>
    <string name="level2Instructions9">Hope you enjoyed the game and keep practicing, perhaps try playing with a friend!</string>
    <string name="instructionsYouWon">Congrats! You won!</string>
    <string name="instructionsOpponentWon">Sorry! Your opponent won.</string>
